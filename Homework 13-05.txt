1.What is nested list?
It refers to list in other list.
2. Can a list store both integers and strings in it?
Yes.
3.Do exercise 1, 2 in this chapter

E1.
What is the Python interpreter’s response to the following?
>>> list(range(10, 0, -2))
The three arguments to the range function are start, stop, and step, respectively. In this
example, start is greater than stop. What happens if start < stop and step <
0? Write a rule for the relationships among start, stop, and step.

=> it generates this list [10, 8, 6, 4, 2]
If start < stop and step < 0, it generates a list containing intergers, with the first integer is start, and next intergers is sum of its previous interger and step while the the result is not bigger than stop.

E2:
Consider this fragment of code:
1 import turtle
2
3 tess = turtle.Turtle()
4 alex = tess
5 alex.color("hotpink")
Does this fragment create one or two turtle instances? Does setting the color of alex
also change the color of tess? Explain in detail.

=> 2 turtles. No.
